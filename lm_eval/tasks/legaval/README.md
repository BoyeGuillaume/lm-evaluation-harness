# Legaval Dataset

This dataset is a collection of legal QA pairs. The dataset is collected from a small collection of 
exams and assignments from multiple schools. In the current state this dataset is not very large, but
the goal is to grow it over time. *THE DATASET SHOULD ONLY BE USED FOR EVALUATION PURPOSE*, and as such we
did not provide any training/testing split for the dataset.
